# This repository is no longer maintained. I have also moved this logic to a Go libary at https://github.com/imdevinc/go-fifa with a client available at https://github.com/imdevinc/fifa-bot

# Slack wc-watcher
This bot uses the undocumented FIFA API's to report on World Cup matches. It will check every 60 seconds for new events. The following events are reported:
+ Goals scored
+ Yellow/Red cards
+ Substitutions
+ Match start/stop
+ Penalty kicks missed/scored

### Sample
[![sample](https://github.com/ImDevinC/wc-watcher/raw/master/ss.png)](#sample)

### Usage
1. Setup a new Slack App (https://api.slack.com/apps) with Webhook permission
1. Copy `private.py.config` to `private.py`
1. In `private.py`, change `WEBHOOK_URL` to point to your Slack webhook
    + If you want to see debug information, which currently pings a heartbeat every hour, also fill in the `DEBUG_WEBHOOK` url with a Slack webhook and set `DEBUG = True`
    + You can also set `WC_COMPETITION = None` in `soccerbot.py` to get all current FIFA matches and see what the output looks like. Just make sure to change it back to `WC_COMPETITION = 17` for world cup only
1. In `private.py`, change `CHANNEL` to the desired channel in your Slack space
1. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Run `python soccerbot.py`

### Card emoji

Repeat for `red_card_new` and `hand_red_card.png`
